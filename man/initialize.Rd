\description{
Constructs data frame with these fields:
\itemize{
\item \emph{unit}:            ID for unit
\item \emph{n}:               previous reference count values (measure of
                                exposure), must at least be 1
\item \emph{y}:               previous count values of interest
\item \emph{n_new}:           new reference count values (measure of
                                exposure), must at least be 1
\item \emph{y_new}:           new count values of interest
\item \emph{true_theta}:      true value of theta (if known)

\item \emph{ucl_true_theta}:  UCL based on n_new and true value of theta
                                (if known)
\item \emph{ucl_nopool}:      UCL based on n_new and no-pooling estimate

Input vectors must be of equal length, with length >= 3.
\emph{unit}, \emph{n}, \emph{y}, \emph{n_new}, \emph{y_new},
and \emph{true_theta} (if known) are initialized using the
corresponding parameters. The other fields (and \emph{true_theta},
if not known) are initialized with NA.
