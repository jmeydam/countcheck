\usage{
select_for_report(d, min_y_new = 0, min_diff = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{d}{Data frame as returned from \emph{countcheck()}}

\item{min_y_new}{Minimum value for y_new}

\item{min_diff}{Minimum difference between y_new and ucl_partpool}
}
\value{
Data frame to be passed in \emph{countcheck_list}
  to \emph{html_report()}
}
\description{
Selects data for report.
}
\details{
Selected columns:
\itemize{
\item \emph{unit}:            ID for unit
\item \emph{y_new}:           new count values of interest
\item \emph{ucl_partpool}:    UCL based on n_new and partial-pooling
                                estimate of theta
\item \emph{fe_partpool}:     factor \emph{f}, with observed y_new
                                exceeding partial-pooling UCL by
                                \emph{f * sd(y_new)},
                                given n_new and partial-pooling estimate
                                of theta
}

Condition that always applies: \emph{y_new} must exceed \emph{ucl_partpool}.

Additional optional conditions:
\itemize{
\item \emph{y_new} exceeds \emph{min_y_new} (default: 0),
\item difference between \emph{y_new} and \emph{ucl_partpool}
  exceeds \emph{min_diff} (default: 0).
}

Returned data is sorted by \emph{fe_partpool} in descending order.
Therefore, items towards the top are less likely to be the result of
random fluctuations, whereas items towards the bottom can usually be
ignored.
