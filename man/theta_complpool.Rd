Complete-pooling estimates of \emph{theta}
}
\description{
For the complete-pooling model we consider \emph{theta_i} to be the same
for all observational units. We assume that observed data can be
treated as coming from a homogeneous source. For all units \emph{i} our
complete-pooling estimate of \emph{theta_i} is the ratio of the sum of
the observed count values of interest \emph{y_i} to the sum of the
reference count values \emph{n_i}.
